Description: InterCellar is implemented as an R/Bioconductor Package
  containing a Shiny app that allows users to interactively analyze the results
  of cell-cell interactions from scRNA-seq data. Starting from precomputed ligand-receptor
  interactions, InterCellar provides three separate views of the dataset (called
  Universes) to explore clusters, genes and functions. Finally, the user can analyse
  interaction-pairs modules and link them to significant functional terms from 
  Pathways or Gene Ontology.
