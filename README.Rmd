an R-Shiny app for interactive exploration of cell-cell interactions


InterCellar allows researchers to interactively analyze the results
of cell-cell interactions from scRNA-seq data. Starting from pre-computed ligand-receptor
  interactions, InterCellar provides three separate views of the dataset (called
  Universes) to explore clusters, genes and functions. Moreover, the user can analyze
  interaction-pair modules and link them to significant functional terms from 
  Pathways or Gene Ontology.

## Installation

InterCellar is currently under revision in [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/).
You can install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("martaint/InterCellar", ref = "main")
```

## Launching the app

Once InterCellar is successfully installed, it can be loaded as follow:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(InterCellar)
```

In order to start the app, please run the following command:

```{r demostart, eval=FALSE}
InterCellar::run_app( reproducible = TRUE)
```

InterCellar should be opening in a browser. If this does not happen automatically, 
please open a browser and navigate to the address shown (for example, `Listening on http://127.0.0.1:6134`). The flag `reproducible = TRUE` ensures that your results will
be reproducible across R sessions.
