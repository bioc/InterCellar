# InterCellar <img src="inst/app/www/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="150" />

an R/Shiny app for interactive analysis and exploration of cell-cell communication based on 
single-cell transcriptomics data


 
## Description

`InterCellar` allows researchers to interactively analyze the results
of cell-cell communication from scRNA-seq data. Starting from pre-computed ligand-receptor
interactions, `InterCellar` provides three separate views of cell-cell communication (in the so-called
`universes`) to explore cell clusters, genes and biological functions. Moreover, `InterCellar` enables the definition of
interaction-pair (int-pair) modules, which are groups of int-pairs that share a similar functional pattern, and links them to significant functional terms from 
Pathways or Gene Ontology. 

`InterCellar` does not require any programming skills and provides options to conduct a customized analysis, several visualizations and the possibility to download figures and tables. 


## Installation

`InterCellar` is distributed as a [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) package and requires R (version "4.1") and Bioconductor (version "3.13").

To install `InterCellar` package enter:

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("InterCellar")
```

## Launching the app

Once `InterCellar` is successfully installed, it can be loaded as follow:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(InterCellar)
```

In order to start the app, please run the following command:

```{r demostart, eval=FALSE}
InterCellar::run_app( reproducible = TRUE )
```

`InterCellar` should be opening in a browser. If this does not happen automatically, 
please open a browser and navigate to the address shown (for example, `Listening on http://127.0.0.1:6134`). The flag `reproducible = TRUE` ensures that your results will
be reproducible across R sessions.
