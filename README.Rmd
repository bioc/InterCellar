# InterCellar: an R-Shiny app for interactive exploration of cell-cell interactions

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='right'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = system.file("app", "www", "logo.png", 
                                           package="InterCellar", mustWork=TRUE))
```

InterCellar allows researchers to interactively analyze the results
of cell-cell interactions from scRNA-seq data. Starting from pre-computed ligand-receptor
  interactions, InterCellar provides three separate views of the dataset (called
  Universes) to explore clusters, genes and functions. Moreover, the user can analyze
  interaction-pair modules and link them to significant functional terms from 
  Pathways or Gene Ontology.

## Installation

InterCellar is currently under revision in [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/).
You can install the development version with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("martaint/InterCellar", ref = "main")
```

## Launching the app

Once InterCellar is successfully installed, it can be loaded as follow:

```{r setup}
library(InterCellar)
```

In order to start the app, please run the following command:

```{r demostart, eval=FALSE}
InterCellar::run_app( reproducible = TRUE)
```

InterCellar should be opening in a browser. If this does not happen automatically, 
please open a browser and navigate to the address shown (for example, *Listening on* http://127.0.0.1:6134). The flag `reproducible = TRUE` ensures that your results will
be reproducible across R sessions.
